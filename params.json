The files are then parsed and sorted by patient's name & \r\nseries description and viewed in a tree view. By clicking on a series, the images are displayed in the viewer.\r\n\r\n##Visualization\r\nThe visualisation of DICOM images is done with the HTML5 canvas element. \r\n\r\n##Browser support\r\nBest performance and user expierence with Google Chrome. HTML5 Upload Folder (webkitdirectory) works only with Chrome. \r\nOther browsers accept multiple files.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\nThere is still work in progress, but basic functionality is in place. TODOs include:\r\n- compressed DICOMs (JPEG, JPEG2000, JPEG-LS)\r\n- ROIs\r\n\r\n##Used libraries\r\n- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) & [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/)\r\n- [jQuery Bootstrap](http://addyosmani.github.io/jquery-ui-bootstrap/)\r\n- [jQuery Custom File Input Plugin](https://github.com/filamentgroup/jQuery-Custom-File-Input)\r\n- [SelectBoxIt](http://gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/)\r\n- [jQueryTree](https://code.google.com/p/dwpe/source/browse/trunk/tree/js/jQuery.tree.js?r=36)\r\n- [jsdicom-lib](https://github.com/Infogosoft/jsdicom-lib)\r\n\r\n##Demo\r\nA demo can be found [here](http://mi-kas.github.com/webDICOM/).\r\n\r\n##License\r\n[GNU GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)\r\n\r\nwebDICOM is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3 as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
